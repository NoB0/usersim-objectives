    "Note that we focus on the dialogue policy and do not consider the other modules such as NLU and NLG of the conversational agent. The interaction model QRFA is used to build the dialogue policies for both the user simulators and the conversational agent. The user's actions are query and feedback, while the agent's actions are request and answer. Additionally, there is an action to finish the conversation that is shared by both.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the experiments, we use the annotated datasets released along with the QRFA model. This choice is motivated by the fact that these datasets comprise different user behaviors to complete an information seeking task. Therefore, we assume a certain level of realism in the user simulators and conversational agents built using these datasets. The table below introduce the datasets.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each datasets, we build a user simulator and a conversational agent.\n",
    "Based one the idea of leave-one-out cross-validation, we study the implication relationships between the objectives of training and evaluation by considering the user population and agent associated to a dataset as the reference and the other user populations as simulated user populations. For each reference pair, we execute the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get transition probabilities from the reference user population and conversational agent.\n",
    "2. Train a success predicator for each simulated user population.\n",
    "3. Generate synthetic dialogues between the reference agent and the simulated user populations. Each dialogue is given a success score using scoring predictors.\n",
    "4. Compute metrics associated to the objectives of training and evaluation.\n",
    "5. Identify the best user simulator for training and evaluation based on the computed metrics.\n"
